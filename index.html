                Hello! <br><br>
                A dedicated and enthusiastic computer science graduate from Pennsylvania State University.
		    I am eager to secure an entry-level software engineering position. Throughout my academic journey at PSU,
		    I have developed a strong foundation in programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python.
		    I am well-versed in database management, specifically MySQL, and have honed my problem-solving abilities to deliver efficient solutions.
		    Passionate about technology and its potential to drive innovation, I am excited to contribute my skills and knowledge to a dynamic organization where I can grow and make a meaningful impact.

                    	<a> The project involves implementing a secure and efficient storage system for a cryptocurrency startup using 16 military-grade
				hard disks configured as JBOD (Just a Bunch of Disks). The system includes mdadm with block caching using the least-recently 
				used (LRU) algorithm to enhance performance, and adds networking support to connect to JBOD servers over the Internet, allowing 
				for on-the-fly switching between JBOD systems to avoid downtime.</a><br><br>	    
                    <li> <a href="https://github.com/arora19/web-app.git">  Hotel Reservation </a>  </li>
                    	<a>This project, developed as part of the CMPSC 431W course, aimed at creating a Hotel Management System.
				This web application, backed by a MySQL database, assists a small hotel in managing and running 
				its operations, providing travelers with a comfortable stay for their holidays or business trips. </a>

                Hello! <br><br>
                A dedicated and enthusiastic computer science graduate from Pennsylvania State University.
		    I am eager to secure an entry-level software engineering position. Throughout my academic journey at PSU,
		    I have developed a strong foundation in programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python.
		    I am well-versed in database management, specifically MySQL, and have honed my problem-solving abilities to deliver efficient solutions.
		    Passionate about technology and its potential to drive innovation, I am excited to contribute my skills and knowledge to a dynamic organization where I can grow and make a meaningful impact.

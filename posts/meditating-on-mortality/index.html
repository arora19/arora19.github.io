  <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I hope you are all in good health in these interesting times. As we quarantine ourselves from the world, we find more times for ourselves. More time to sleep, and binge on content. In the biggest pandemic of our century, we have the comfort of internet. Whether that may be TV, movies, books, Instagram, or of course Twitter. I have been guilty of the binge. Many a times I found myself frustrated, brain-dead. As best as I can tell, my monkey brain wants to go out, and have human connections. What better time to write to friends!</p>
<p>In the midst of these binges, a particular theme has been recurring in the past few days; Meditating on your mortality. I was first introduced to this Stoic practice by <a href="https://tim.blog/podcast/">Tim Ferriss</a>, surely in one of his many high quality podcasts. “You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think.” - Marcus Aurelius (Roman emperor from 161 to 180)</p>
<p>A few days ago, Tim came out with this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWwNocaIWxg">Life Is Short: How to Add a Sense of Urgency</a> , and this in part prompted this letter you are reading. Meditating on your death seems morbid. I want to emphasize that it is not. The practice helps filter out the bullshit in life. Understanding the permanence and finite-ness of time, providing a sense of urgency. Today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60KJz1BVTyU&amp;t=2749s">I came across this on the Artificial Intelligence Podcast</a> - &ldquo;I only have so many more sunsets and sunrises to watch. Am I not gonna get up for it?&rdquo; - Jack Dorsey (CEO Twitter, Square). That hit a nerve.</p>
<p>I plan to keep writing to you. Discuss more ponderings, and share some great content that I uncover in my binges. Tell me what you think, or just say Hi. :)</p>
<p>Till next time, here&rsquo;s an article I recommend you to read: <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/">IT’S TIME TO BUILD by Marc Andreessen</a>.</p>
